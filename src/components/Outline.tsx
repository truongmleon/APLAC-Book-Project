                    People care too much. 
                    People care too much about their surroundings. 
                    People care too much about other people. 
                    People care too much about what other people think of them.

                <p data-aos="zoom-in-up">
                How can people <i>choose</i> what they care about without sacrificing time and resources?
                    It's not as simple as sorting apples and oranges.
                    People tend to notice that when they donâ€™t care, everything seems to work out in place. The pieces of the puzzle suddenly fit together without much measure.

                When I was in algebra, I was always trying to aim for that 100%. In the last test, I stopped caring about getting a perfect score and it just so happened that was the only math test I got a 100% that year.
                    Some could argue it was a mere coincidence and they might be right, but I felt a lot more at ease that day when I took it.

                <p data-aos="zoom-in-up">We all know it. You know it. Perhaps you're scared of <i>it</i>.
                Most people in their lives have experienced social anxiety.
                I know I did at least.
                But really, only a small margin of people care about who you are and what your do, which could be
                your closest friends or your biggest haters. 
                It took me a long time to realize this, and realizing was all it took to move another step in the life puzzle.
                That step was the opportunity to feel more confident and happier.
                </p>
                <p data-aos="zoom-in-up">Isn't it weird that not caring is the solution to some of our problems? </p>
                <h3 data-aos="fade-up-right" className="headers">So why the f*ck should I read a book about not giving f*cks?</h3>
