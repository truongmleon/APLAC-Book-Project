                Subtlety #1: Not giving a f*ck does not mean being indifferent; it
                means being comfortable with being different
                </h3>
                <p className="subtlety-text">
                Indifferent people want to be indifferent because they love to care. They care about what other people think about their ideas and style. In truth, there is nothing called not caring; it’s psychologically impossible to not care. Instead of not caring, we think about what we should care about. When people don’t care, they don’t care about the adversity for their goals. Everything not significant to them is dropped.

                    sipped my mocha, and downloaded another season of The Wire. Sorry, Mom. But instead, I was indignant. I was pissed off. I said, “No, screw that, Mom. We’re going to lawyer the f*ck up and go after this a*shole."</i>
