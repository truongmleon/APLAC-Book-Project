                Mark Manson is an American humor writer and blogger. After college, all he did was blog about life guidance, but after a while, he also began to write books. Manson writes for adults who desire self-improvement or people who just have too much stuff on their plate. He wants to give self-help advice while being humorous because he thinks advice is best presented in a fun manner. In his books, he depicts situations using profanity to make the text engaging with a serious outlook.
