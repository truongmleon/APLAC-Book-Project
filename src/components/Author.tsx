                <p data-aos="flip-right" id="about-mark">Mark Manson is an American self-help-self-proclaimed-psychologist-humor-writer and blogger. Bloggling life advice was all he really did out of college, but
                    in a few years, he started writing books as well. He wrote for fun and tried to be helpful.
                    Manson writes for adults who desire for self-improvement. 
                    The reason for this is that he wants to give self-help advice while being humorous because he thinks 
                    advice is best presented in a fun manner.
                    In his books, he depicts situations using profanity to make the text engaging with a serious outlook at the end.
