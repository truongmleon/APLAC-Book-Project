                    self-help writing. Developing life advice with humor and such unique word choice, he start gaining 
                    a following as a million people started reading his blogs every month.

                    to then becoming a self-help influencer. His best selling book, <i>The Subtle Art of Not Giving a F*ck</i> sold more than 10 million copies globally.
