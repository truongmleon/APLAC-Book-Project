                He sets the stage by talking about Charles Bukowski, an alcoholic, a chronic gambler, a lout, and a poet. Bukowski wanted to be a writer, but his work was rejected by every journal and newspaper. It was said his work was terrible. Horrid. Boorish. Disgusting. Drinking alcohol was his way of coping after rejection after rejection. An editor showed curiosity to Bukowski and gave him a chance to publish his first novel, <i>Post Office</i>.
