                    He graduated from Boston University in 2007 and started a blog. 
                    His posts were about dating-advice and in 2010 he transitioned to self-help writing. 
                    The internet really started to gain traction around this time among younger generations. 
                    A place where one could find endless amounts of information was something people didn’t think was possible. 
                    Developing life advice with humor and such unique word choice, he started gaining a following as a million people started reading his blogs every month. 
                    It’s thanks to the internet that Manson was able provide self-help advice from his experiences, which lead to the growth of his audience. 
                    Manson basically went from being a broke college student to making crappy blogs to then becoming a self-help influencer.
                    In the book <i>The Subtle Art of Not Giving a F*ck</i>, he tells numerous stories across many timelines to try to get the audience to understand what is being portrayed.
                    The stories told are meaningful and help the audience relate with a sense of humor.

                    An example of this is when Manson sets up the stage by talking about Charles Bukowski, an alcoholic, a chronic gambler, a lout, and a poet. 
                    Bukowski wanted to be a writer, but his work was rejected by every journal, newspaper, publisher, and magazine. 
                    It was said his work was terrible. Horrid. Boorish. Disgusting.
                    Drinking alcohol was his way of coping after rejection after rejection.
                    An editor showed curiosity to Bukowski and gave him a chance to publish his first novel, <i>Post Office</i>. 
                    He went on and then published hundreds of poems and six novels. 
                    Bukowski actually didn't care about his success.
                    He was still having drink after drink.
                    He was still sleeping with woman after woman.
                    The act of not trying to be anyone else overcame the odds.
                    Bukowski knew he was a loser and wholeheartedly accepted it as he didn’t try to change; he didn’t care. 
                    Manson says Bukowski would be the last person to read a self-improvement book.
