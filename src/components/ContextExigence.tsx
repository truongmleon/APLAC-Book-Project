                    Manson started a blog in in 2007
                    with posts about dating-advice and in 2010 he transitioned to self-help writing. 
                    The internet really started to gain traction around this time among younger generations espically with the debut of the iPhone.
                    Now, there was a place where one could efficiently find endless amounts of information in a matter of seconds.
                    A quick search like "How do I get my EX back?" would pop up hundreds of resuts.
                    As Manson was developing life advice with humor and such unique word choice, he started gaining a following as a million people started reading his blogs every month. 
                    It’s thanks to the internet that Manson was able provide self-help advice from his experiences, which led to the growth of his audience. 
                    Manson basically went from being a broke college student to making crappy blogs to then becoming a self-help influencer.
                    In the book <i>The Subtle Art of Not Giving a F*ck</i>, he tells numerous stories across many timelines to try to get the audience to understand what is being portrayed.
                    The stories told are meaningful and help the audience relate with a sense of humor.

                    Manson viewed the self-help industry poorly as not very helpful to society. The culture of mindless positivity just wasn’t very practical. His book is a response to that – to help people choose what is important in life. He wants to give a healthier perspective on pain, trauma, and problems. People struggle – he wants people to struggle better.
                    The people who want self-help think something is wrong with themselves or someone who is already good wants to elimate gaps to become a better person.
                    The person who thinks something is wrong with them lacks self acceptance
