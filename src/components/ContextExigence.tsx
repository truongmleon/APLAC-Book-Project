                    He graduated from Boston University in 2007 and started a blog. 
                    His posts were about dating-advice and in 2010 he transitioned to self-help writing. 
                    The internet was blowing up. 
                    A place where one could find endless amounts of information was something people didn’t think was possible. 
                    Developing life advice with humor and such unique word choice, he started gaining a following as a million people started reading his blogs every month. 
                    It’s thanks to the internet that Manson was able provide self-help advice from his experiences, which lead to the growth of his audience. 
                    Manson basically went from being a broke college student to making crappy blogs to then becoming a self-help influencer.

                    Manson viewed the self-help industry poorly as not very helpful to society. 
                    The culture of mindless positivity just wasn’t very practical. 
                    His book is a response to that – to help people choose what is important in life. 
                    He wants to give a healthier perspective on pain, trauma, and problems. People struggle – he wants people to struggle better.
